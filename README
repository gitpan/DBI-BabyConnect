DBI-BabyConnect version 0.93
============================

The previous version 0.92 is missing many files and instructions on
how to use the DBI::BabyConnect. That version was my first module
to upload to CPAN and it has many bugs. Use version 0.93 instead..

DBI::BabyConnect version 0.93 is stable and has been tested on
Linux Fedora with Apache2 MD2.
